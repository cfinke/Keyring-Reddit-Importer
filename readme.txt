The only data that Reddit for Keyring sends to another server is your Reddit OAuth parameters in order to authenticate you with Reddit. None of your personal data, from Reddit or otherwise, is sent anywhere else.

Your Reddit posts and comments are imported directly from Reddit to your WordPress blog and do not pass through any third-party server.
